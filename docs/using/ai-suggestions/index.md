## Introduction
Say goodbye to the hassle of searching for the right collection or tag when you save a new bookmark — our new ✦ AI model automatically suggests the perfect ones for you!

For collections, we suggest **only yours** — keeping everything tailored to your personal style. For tags, your existing tags are suggested first, followed by new tag ideas marked with a ✚ icon so you can easily tell them apart. Whenever you create a new collection or tag, AI takes note and includes it in future suggestions.

## Organize many bookmarks at once {#bulk}
Need to tag, sort into collections, or clean up a large number of bookmarks? Ask [✦ Stella — AI assistant](/stella) to do it for you. Stella can move unsorted bookmarks to the right collections, tag them, merge duplicate tags, and more — all in plain language.

## FAQ
### Why don't I see any suggestions?
The AI model might not have enough data to make predictions yet.
Please start by creating a few collections and tags, and apply them to your bookmarks.

### What if the suggestions are incorrect?
If the suggestions don't seem quite right, just select the correct ones when organizing your bookmarks. This feedback helps the AI model learn and improve over time. If you need further assistance, feel free to reach out to our support team.

### How to turn off suggestions?
