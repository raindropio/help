Raindrop offers robust search capabilities, allowing you to locate bookmarks by various details, including title, description, notes, URL, tags, type, date, or the [full content](#full-text-search) of a webpage, EPUB, or PDF (without OCR).

Enhance your search experience with the [Pro version](../../billing/premium-features.md), which supports natural language queries. This feature means you don't need to remember exact keywords—simply type your question as you would normally speak.
Additionally, the [Pro version](../../billing/premium-features.md) allows you to search for bookmarks in multiple languages.

Refine your search results further by using our [advanced search operators](#operators), designed to help you find exactly what you're looking for with precision.

## Recent Searches {#recent}
Raindrop will remember your ten most recent searches so you can easily return to the list of results.
Plus, these recent searches will sync across your apps so you can continue a search on another device or computer.

## Full-Text Search {#full-text-search}
Raindrop can search through the entire content of every bookmark, EPUB and PDF (no OCR) you’ve saved, making it extremely easy to find what you’re looking for. It's like your personal Google!

Your bookmarks are indexed automatically, no need to do anything. Usually only meaningful content of web-page is indexed. Ads, navigation, comments and so on are stripped if possible.

    - Indexing is happen with slight delay, usually few minutes
