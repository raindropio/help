Highlighting while reading has enormous benefits.
It helps you engage more deeply with the text, comprehend dense subjects, and easily revisit key passages in the future.

![](intro.png)

You can create highlights in Raindrop.io [Browser extension](../../getting-started/install-extension/index.md), [Desktop](https://raindrop.io/download), [Web](https://app.raindrop.io) and Mobile app (soon).

:::note
Highlighting is available for all users. There's no limit on total number of pages and highlights.  
But annotations (notes) is [premium feature](../../billing/premium-features.md).

## FAQ
### Why you need additional browser extension permission? {#extension-permission}
To be able to see highlights next time you visit same page we need additional permission called `Access data on websites`.
Don't worry we not track you or send data to third-parties. We just check URL of a page and then load your saved highlights.

Many extensions have this permission by default. But not ours. We decided to ask you explicitly.
