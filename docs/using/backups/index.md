You do not need to create any special backups of your Raindrop.io items, all data is **securely stored** in the cloud.
But backups can be handy when you **need to restore** some accidentialy deleted collections or bookmarks.
Or transfer data to browser or third-party service.

## Downloading a backup
Request a new backup file of all your data anytime in [Backups](https://app.raindrop.io/settings/backups) section.   
Just click `Create new`. You will receive an email in next few minutes.

## Restoring a backup
