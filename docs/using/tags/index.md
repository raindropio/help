Tags allow for detailed characterization of an item.
You can tag items based on their topics, methods, status, ratings, or even based on your own workflow (e.g., `to-read`).

Items can have as many tags as you like, and you can [filter your library](#by-tag) (or a specific collection) to show items having a specific set of one or more tags.

Raindrop.io tags are special. They allow you to name them using any characters, in any language and most importantly – with spaces.
