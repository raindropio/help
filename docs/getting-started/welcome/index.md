Congratulations on your new Raindrop.io account!  
Click 🔍 **Search** at the top right corner of this page to find what you're looking for.

Not sure what to do first? Start here:

**`Step 1`: Migrate to Raindrop.io** - [import your old bookmarks](../import.md) and [automate saving](../../integrations/automation.md) of your new favorites/likes from Youtube, Twitter and other sites 

**`Step 2`: Take your bookmarks anywhere** – download free Raindrop.io [apps](../download-app/index.md) and [extensions](../install-extension/index.md) for 10+ platforms including web, desktop, mobile, and more.

There’s no one-size-fits-all way to use Raindrop.io.
The best system is the one you stick with. Start simple to build strong productivity habits, then explore new features and ways of organizing your bookmarks as you go.

Explore the Help Center and if you have any questions at all, <a onClick={()=>Beacon('open')} target="_self">let us know</a>.  
We’re happy to help any time.
