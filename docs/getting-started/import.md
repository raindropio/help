## Supported Formats
### Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge, Brave (HTML)
We support importing any bookmarks from browser or third-party service.
Here how to get export file from popular browsers:
[Chrome](https://www.wikihow.com/Export-Bookmarks-from-Chrome),
[Safari](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/websites/web-development/export-safari-bookmarks/),
[Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer)

### CSV
We support almost any `CSV` file generated by third-party bookmarking apps.


#### How to prepare my own CSV file?
If you want to upload your own CSV file just make sure:

- Comma delimited
- Columns: `url`, `folder`, `title`, `note`, `tags`, `created`
- `url` column is required, other are optional
- use `/` to specify nested `folder`, like `a/b/c`
- to have multiple `tags` just put them in quotes, like `"tag1, tag2"`
- `created` column should have Unix timestamp or date in ISO 8601 format
- Column order doesn't matter

Here an example CSV file:
```csv
folder,url,title,note,tags,created
"Folder",http://google.com,Google,"Note","search, app",1629980125
"Folder/Nested folder",http://yahoo.com,Yahoo,"Note","search, app",1629980125
```

[Validate your CSV](https://csvlint.io/) file before uploading!

### TXT
Txt file should have a url per row

### ENEX (Evernote)
You can transfer all your web clips (bookmarks) from Evernote to Raindrop.io, including descriptions and tags.
To do this, [export your notes from Evernote](https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/209005557-Export-notes-and-notebooks) in the **ENEX** file format.

When exporting, ensure you only select `Created Date`, `Tags`, and `Source URL`, as other fields take up unnecessary space and will be ignored during the import process.

### Pinterest
Pinterest itself doesn't have any tools to export your data. But you can try to use great third-party app called [Pinback](https://pinbackit.github.io/) that can help you download export file.
Just follow instructions on [Pinback](https://pinbackit.github.io/) site.

### Edge Collections
Go to specific collection, click `... / Copy All` then create a `.txt` file and paste content of clipboard to it. Now you have a `.txt` file that can be imported to Raindrop. 

### Pocket, Pinterest, Diigo, Dropmark, GoodLinks, Cubox, Are.na, etc...
You can transfer bookmarks from almost any other service. Simply request an `HTML`, `CSV`, or `JSON` file from service that you use.

## Limitations
- Ensure the file size is no larger than 300 MB; if it is, compress it into a ZIP file
- Evernote limitations:
    - Attachments are not supported yet
    - We only support transferring Evernote web clips (notes created using the Evernote Web Clipper). Other types of notes, including those containing bunch of links, are not supported.
